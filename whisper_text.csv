2412-153947-0000,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,/content/audios/2412-153947-0000.flac, Preface to the second edition.
2412-153947-0001,THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE,/content/audios/2412-153947-0001.flac," This is a mistake, though, a perfectly natural one."
2412-153947-0002,ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER,/content/audios/2412-153947-0002.flac," On my return, I purposely avoided looking into it until I had sent back my last revises to the printer."
2412-153947-0003,THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER,/content/audios/2412-153947-0003.flac," Then I had much pleasure in reading it, but was indeed surprised that the many little points of similarity between the two books, in spite of their entire independence to one another."

2412-153947-0005,I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE,/content/audios/2412-153947-0005.flac," I am surprised, however, that the book at which such an example of the species misuse of analogy would seem most naturally leveled should have occurred to no reviewer, neither shall I mention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint given will suffice."
2412-153947-0006,BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER,/content/audios/2412-153947-0006.flac," But this had an effect of which I have little reason to complain for I was allowed almost to call them lifelong self-dosevers to their faces. And they said it was quite true, but that it did not matter."
2412-153947-0007,I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES,/content/audios/2412-153947-0007.flac, I must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures.

2412-153947-0010,I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO,/content/audios/2412-153947-0010.flac," I see for my second preface that I took the book to Miss Eur's Chapman and Hall, May 1, 1871, and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers, I let it sleep till I took it to Mr. Trubner early in 1872."

2412-153947-0015,I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD,/content/audios/2412-153947-0015.flac," I am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of Eroan that were repeatedly rewritten, but from those that had only a single writing, I would gladly cut out some 40 or 50 pages if I could."

2412-153948-0000,IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF,/content/audios/2412-153948-0000.flac," If the reader will excuse me, I will say nothing of my antecedents, nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country.

Men took up their 50,000 or 100,000 acres of country, going inland one behind the other. Till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up.
